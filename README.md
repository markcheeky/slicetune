# Slicetune [WIP]

A simple, flexible and non-invasive parameter-efficient method for finetuning large neural models.


### TODO

- [ ] benchmark the method
- [ ] write tests
- [ ] write docs
- [ ] write examples
- [ ] add loading and saving of only finetuned weights
- [ ] write a slicetuner for Conv2d and Embedding like LoRA does?


### DONE
- [x] slicetune.nn.Layer
- [x] slicetune.nn.Linear
- [x] util fn for patching model
- [x] util fn for fusing model
- [x] util fn for description
